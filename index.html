            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              As a student in Southern New Hampshire University’s Software Engineering program, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software design, secure coding, and systematic problem-solving. 
              My academic work has included a variety of projects that simulate real-world challenges, from building full-stack applications to implementing automated testing and integrating security controls at every stage of development. 
              These experiences have strengthened my technical proficiency in programming languages, database management, version control systems, and Agile methodologies, while also reinforcing my ability to produce maintainable, efficient, and user-focused solutions.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Collaboration has been a consistent element of my growth, as many projects have required effective communication with team members, task delegation, and integration of diverse perspectives. 
              I have learned to translate complex technical concepts into accessible language for both technical and non-technical audiences. This skill has proven critical in ensuring alignment between project requirements and deliverables. 
              I have also developed resilience and adaptability, embracing feedback and leveraging it to refine both my technical output and my approach to problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I plan to further enhance my expertise in cloud computing, DevSecOps practices, and advanced software architecture patterns. 
              I recognize the importance of staying current with emerging tools, frameworks, and security standards in an ever-changing technology landscape. 
              My goal is to graduate from SNHU with a well-rounded and industry-ready skill set that will enable me to design and implement secure, innovative, and impactful software solutions. 
              By continuing to apply secure-by-design principles and focusing on professional growth, I aim to make meaningful contributions in both individual and team-based software engineering roles.

            <h2>Project Enhancements</h2>
            
            <h3>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h3>
            
            <p>
              The artifact I’m showcasing is a 3D scene project that recreates a small bathroom, originally developed in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. 
              The scene features a toilet, a sink, and a light fixture, all constructed using basic geometric primitives like boxes and cylinders. 
              I programmed the scene using OpenGL and applied textures to add realistic surface details. 
              Users can explore the environment using a virtual camera, which is controlled through keyboard and mouse inputs. 
              This project was created to highlight my skills in 3D modeling, texture mapping, and interactive scene navigation within a computational graphics framework. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my capability to develop interactive 3D environments—an essential skill in both software engineering and computational graphics.
              The project illustrates my proficiency with OpenGL, where I applied core 3D modeling principles and basic transformations to recreate real-world items in a digital space. 
              The elements of this artifact that most effectively highlight my skills are:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><b>3D Modeling</b>: Creating virtual representations of real-life objects like a desk and monitors using basic shapes such as boxes and cylinders.</li>
              <li><b>Texture Mapping</b>: Applying surface textures to enhance realism, including tiled patterns for the floor and walls.</li>
              <li><b>Interactive Navigation</b>: Developing camera controls that enable users to move through and interact with the scene dynamically.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              The artifact was enhanced by adding detailed comments throughout the code, which serve to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
              These comments not only make the program easier to understand for others who may review or maintain it in the future, but they also reflect my ability to write clear, organized, and maintainable code. 
              By documenting key logic, transformation steps, and rendering processes, I ensured that the structure and flow of the program are more accessible and easier to follow, which is a crucial practice in professional software development.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the enhancement process, I initially planned to transition the project from OpenGL to Blender to take advantage of Blender's advanced rendering capabilities. 
              However, I ultimately decided to shift my focus toward improving and updating the core components of the original OpenGL code instead. 
              While this change in direction was challenging, I believed it was the right decision to better demonstrate my programming skills, particularly in adhering to best coding practices. 
              By refining the original codebase, I was able to highlight my strengths in clean, maintainable code, logical structuring, and effective use of computational graphics principles—key aspects that are essential for a professional software development environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Revisiting this project allowed me to appreciate the significance of fundamental practices, such as writing clear and descriptive comments within my code. 
              It reminded me how proper documentation can greatly enhance code readability and ease future updates or debugging. 
              I didn’t encounter many obstacles during the revision process, aside from the initial challenge of remembering the purpose and function of each code block. 
              This experience reinforced the value of thorough documentation and consistent coding practices, especially when returning to a project after some time has passed.
            </p>
