            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              As a student in Southern New Hampshire Universityâ€™s Software Engineering program, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software design, secure coding, and systematic problem-solving. 
              My academic work has included a variety of projects that simulate real-world challenges, from building full-stack applications to implementing automated testing and integrating security controls at every stage of development. 
              These experiences have strengthened my technical proficiency in programming languages, database management, version control systems, and Agile methodologies, while also reinforcing my ability to produce maintainable, efficient, and user-focused solutions.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Collaboration has been a consistent element of my growth, as many projects have required effective communication with team members, task delegation, and integration of diverse perspectives. 
              I have learned to translate complex technical concepts into accessible language for both technical and non-technical audiences. This skill has proven critical in ensuring alignment between project requirements and deliverables. 
              I have also developed resilience and adaptability, embracing feedback and leveraging it to refine both my technical output and my approach to problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I plan to further enhance my expertise in cloud computing, DevSecOps practices, and advanced software architecture patterns. 
              I recognize the importance of staying current with emerging tools, frameworks, and security standards in an ever-changing technology landscape. 
              My goal is to graduate from SNHU with a well-rounded and industry-ready skill set that will enable me to design and implement secure, innovative, and impactful software solutions. 
              By continuing to apply secure-by-design principles and focusing on professional growth, I aim to make meaningful contributions in both individual and team-based software engineering roles.
